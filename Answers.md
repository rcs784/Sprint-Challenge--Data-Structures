1.  
    * Stack: Last-in, first-out (LIFO)
    * Queue: First-in, first-out (FIFO)
2.  
    * Linked List: O(n)
    * Hash Table: O(log n)
    * Binary Search Tree: O(log n)
3.  Advantages of using a hash table in JavaScript instead of an array include faster retrieval time (on average logarithmic instead of linear) and the ability to set any data type, rather than just integers, as keys pointing to values.
